AI Algorithm Design

1. Ball Movement Prediction

The AI will predict the ball's future position based on its current position, velocity, and direction. The mathematical function will calculate the ball's trajectory and determine where it will intersect with the AI paddle's vertical position.
2. Mathematical Function

The function will use the following parameters:

    ball_x, ball_y: Current position of the ball.

    ball_vx, ball_vy: Current velocity of the ball in the x and y directions.

    paddle_y: Current vertical position of the AI paddle.

    accuracy_factor: A variable (between 0 and 1) that influences the accuracy of the AI's prediction.

The function will calculate the ball's future position using the equation of motion:
future_y=ball_y+ball_vy⋅(paddle_x−ball_xball_vx)
future_y=ball_y+ball_vy⋅(ball_vxpaddle_x−ball_x​)

Where:

    paddle_x is the fixed x-coordinate of the AI paddle.

    future_y is the predicted y-coordinate where the ball will intersect the paddle.

3. Introducing Prediction Error

To simulate imperfect predictions, we introduce an error term based on the accuracy_factor. The error term will be a random value scaled by (1 - accuracy_factor).
predicted_y=future_y+error_term
predicted_y=future_y+error_term

Where:
error_term=random.uniform(−E,E)⋅(1−accuracy_factor)
error_term=random.uniform(−E,E)⋅(1−accuracy_factor)

    E is the maximum possible error (e.g., the height of the game screen).

    random.uniform(-E, E) generates a random value between -E and E.

4. Paddle Movement

The AI paddle will move toward the predicted y-coordinate (predicted_y) with a speed proportional to the distance between its current position and the target position.
