Below are the following milestones we plan to reach while developing Ping.


To-Do
- Pause menu now actually pauses and unpauses properly
    - There is an issue however, when going into the settings menu and then hitting back, it just resumes the game. 
    - This should be remedied by having the game iterate a step back to the pause menu

Core Features:
- Exit Button in Title screen
- Debug Mode
- Bigger Game Window
- Remediated AI (AI that can realistically be beat. Atleast 50% of the time.)


Ideas to Flesh out:
- Add a score keeping system
    - Used to "win" levels as well as for a leaderboard
- Add power ups/ upgrades
- Make different arenas


Implemented Features:
- Pause Menu
    - Fixed Settings Menu Initializiation
- Settings Menu
    - Added Change Name function
