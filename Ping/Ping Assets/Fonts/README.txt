Pixel Font Instructions
======================

This game uses the "Press Start 2P" pixel font for its retro-style text rendering.

To ensure the best experience, you have two options:

1. Install the font system-wide (Recommended):
   - Download Press Start 2P from Google Fonts:
     https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P
   - Install the font on your system
   - The game will automatically use the installed font

2. Add the font to the game directory:
   - Download the PressStart2P-Regular.ttf file
   - Place it in this directory (Ping Assets/Fonts/)
   - The game will find and use the font automatically

If neither option is available, the game will fall back to a default system font.
